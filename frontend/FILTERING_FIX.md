# Post Filtering Fix

## Problem
User's own posts were appearing in "All Posts" and "Following" tabs even though they should only appear in "My Posts" tab.

## Root Cause
There were two `useEffect` hooks handling post filtering:
1. First hook (lines 156-228): Correctly filtered posts based on tabs
2. Second hook (lines 230-285): Was **overwriting** the filtered posts when there was no hashtag or search query

The second hook had this problematic code:
```javascript
if (!filterHashtag && !searchQuery) {
  if (!showFollowedOnly) {
    setFilteredPosts(posts); // ❌ This reset all filtering!
  }
  return;
}
```

This was resetting `filteredPosts` to all `posts`, ignoring the tab-based filtering.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Second useEffect
Changed the logic to NOT override tab filtering:
```javascript
if (!filterHashtag && !searchQuery) {
  return; // ✅ Let the tab filtering handle it
}
```

### 2. Simplified Display Logic
Changed from:
```javascript
const displayPosts = (filterHashtag || searchQuery) ? filteredPosts : posts;
```

To:
```javascript
const displayPosts = filteredPosts; // ✅ Always use filtered posts
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive console logs to track filtering:
- "📝 MY POSTS TAB - Showing only my posts"
- "👥 FOLLOWING TAB - Following list"
- "🚫 Excluding my post"
- "📋 ALL POSTS TAB - Registered users"

## Current Behavior

### All Posts Tab (`/all-posts`)
```javascript
posts.filter(post => {
  // Exclude own posts
  if (post.author === currentUser) return false;
  
  // Show only registered users
  return hasRegisteredProfile(post.author);
});
```

### Following Tab (`/following`)
```javascript
posts.filter(post => {
  // Exclude own posts
  if (post.author === currentUser) return false;
  
  // Show only followed users
  return followingList.includes(post.author);
});
```

### My Posts Tab (`/my-posts`)
```javascript
posts.filter(post => {
  // Show only own posts
  return post.author === currentUser;
});
```

## Testing

Open browser console and check for these logs:

### When on "All Posts" tab:
```
📋 ALL POSTS TAB - Registered users: X
🚫 Excluding posts from: 0x...
🚫 Excluding my post: 1
🚫 Excluding my post: 2
✅ Post from registered user: 0x...
📊 ALL POSTS TAB - Posts from registered users (excluding mine): Y
```

### When on "Following" tab:
```
👥 FOLLOWING TAB - Following list: [...]
📝 Total posts: X
🚫 Excluding posts from: 0x...
🚫 Excluding my post: 1
✅ Showing post from followed user: 0x...
📊 FOLLOWING TAB - Filtered posts (excluding mine): Y
```

### When on "My Posts" tab:
```
📝 MY POSTS TAB - Showing only my posts: X
📝 Current user address: 0x...
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Create a post
2. ✅ Go to "All Posts" - your post should NOT appear
3. ✅ Go to "Following" - your post should NOT appear
4. ✅ Go to "My Posts" - your post SHOULD appear
5. ✅ Check browser console for correct filtering logs
6. ✅ Verify URL changes correctly (/all-posts, /following, /my-posts)
