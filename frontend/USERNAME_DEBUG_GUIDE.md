# Username Display Debug Guide

## Issue
Notifications showing "@Anonymous User" instead of the actual username of who followed you.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Username Loading Logic

The `NotificationItem` component now has a comprehensive fallback system:

1. **Primary**: Fetch from blockchain using `getUserProfile(address)`
2. **Fallback 1**: Check localStorage cache (`user_profiles_cache`)
3. **Fallback 2**: Check if user is in registered users list
4. **Final**: Show "Anonymous User" if all else fails

### Debug Logging Added

When you open notifications, check the browser console for these logs:

```javascript
🔍 Loading profile for: 0x...
📊 Author profile data: [username, ipfsHash, ...]
📝 Username from blockchain: "JohnDoe"
📝 IPFS hash: "Qm..."
✅ Found username from blockchain: JohnDoe
📸 Profile data from IPFS: {...}
```

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open notifications panel
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Look for the logs mentioned above

### Step 2: Check What's Logged

#### If you see:
```
📊 Author profile data: ["", ""]
```
**Problem**: User hasn't created a profile yet or profile is empty
**Solution**: The person who followed you needs to create their profile first

#### If you see:
```
📊 Author profile data: undefined
```
**Problem**: Blockchain query failed
**Solution**: Check network connection or contract address

#### If you see:
```
📊 Author profile data: ["JohnDoe", "Qm..."]
✅ Found username from blockchain: JohnDoe
```
**Success**: Username should display correctly!

### Step 3: Check localStorage

Open Console and run:
```javascript
// Check user profiles cache
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user_profiles_cache') || '{}')

// Check registered users
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('all_registered_users') || '[]')
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: User Has No Profile
**Symptom**: `authorProfile[0]` is empty string `""`
**Cause**: The person who followed you hasn't created their profile
**Solution**: They need to:
1. Click on their profile icon
2. Fill in username and bio
3. Upload profile picture
4. Save profile

### Issue 2: Blockchain Query Not Working
**Symptom**: `authorProfile` is `undefined` or `null`
**Cause**: Contract query failed
**Solutions**:
- Check if wallet is connected
- Verify contract address is correct
- Check network connection
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue 3: Profile Exists But Not Loading
**Symptom**: Logs show profile data but username still shows "Anonymous User"
**Cause**: Timing issue or state not updating
**Solution**: 
- Close and reopen notifications panel
- Refresh the page
- Clear cache and reload

### Issue 4: IPFS Loading Slow
**Symptom**: Username loads but image doesn't
**Cause**: IPFS gateway is slow
**Solution**: This is normal, image will load eventually

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Have Someone Follow You
1. Ask a friend to follow your account
2. Make sure they have created their profile first
3. Check if notification shows their username

### Test 2: Check Console Logs
1. Open notifications
2. Check console for debug logs
3. Verify username is being fetched from blockchain

### Test 3: Verify Profile Data
```javascript
// In console, check the follower's profile
// Replace ADDRESS with their wallet address
const profile = await readContract({
  address: 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  abi: contractData.abi,
  functionName: 'getUserProfile',
  args: ['FOLLOWER_ADDRESS']
});
console.log('Profile:', profile);
```

## Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly:
```
Notifications (1)
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [Avatar] 👤 @JohnDoe       │
│          started following  │
│          you               │
│          Just now      🟠  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Console Logs When Working:
```
🔍 Loading profile for: 0x1234...
📊 Author profile data: ["JohnDoe", "QmXYZ...", true]
📝 Username from blockchain: JohnDoe
📝 IPFS hash: QmXYZ...
✅ Found username from blockchain: JohnDoe
📸 Profile data from IPFS: {image: "data:image/...", bio: "..."}
```

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Person who followed you has created their profile
- [ ] Their username is not empty
- [ ] Wallet is connected
- [ ] Network is correct (Helios Testnet)
- [ ] Contract address is correct
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] Try refreshing the page
- [ ] Try clearing cache

## Manual Override (Temporary)

If you want to test with a hardcoded username temporarily:

```javascript
// In NotificationItem component, replace:
setAuthorUsername('Anonymous User');

// With:
setAuthorUsername(notification.from.slice(0, 8) + '...');
// This will show shortened address like "0x1234..."
```

## Next Steps

1. Open notifications panel
2. Check browser console
3. Share the console logs if issue persists
4. Verify the person who followed you has a profile

The username should now display correctly once the follower has created their profile!
