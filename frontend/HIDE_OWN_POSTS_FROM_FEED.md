# Hide Own Posts from Main Feed

## Overview
Updated the Feed component so that when a user creates a post, it's visible to all other users but NOT visible to the user who created it in the main feed. Users can still see their own posts in the "My Posts" tab.

## Changes Made

### Updated Feed Filtering Logic

**Before:**
The code was checking for registered users from localStorage, which could cause inconsistencies.

**After:**
Simplified logic that ALWAYS excludes the current user's posts from the main feed.

```javascript
} else {
  // Show all posts from OTHER users (never show own posts in main feed)
  console.log('📋 ALL POSTS TAB - Total posts:', posts.length);
  console.log('🚫 Current user address:', address);
  
  const postsFromOthers = posts.filter(post => {
    // ALWAYS exclude own posts in main feed
    const isMyPost = post.author.toLowerCase() === address?.toLowerCase();
    
    if (isMyPost) {
      console.log('🚫 Excluding my own post:', post.id?.toString());
      return false;
    }
    
    console.log('✅ Showing post from other user:', post.author);
    return true;
  });
  
  console.log('📊 ALL POSTS TAB - Posts from others (excluding mine):', postsFromOthers.length);
  setFilteredPosts(postsFromOthers);
}
```

## How It Works

### Feed Tabs Behavior:

#### 1. **All Posts Tab** (Main Feed)
- ✅ Shows posts from ALL other users
- ❌ NEVER shows your own posts
- 🎯 Purpose: See what others are posting

#### 2. **Following Tab**
- ✅ Shows posts from users you follow
- ❌ NEVER shows your own posts
- 🎯 Purpose: See what your followed users are posting

#### 3. **My Posts Tab**
- ✅ Shows ONLY your own posts
- ❌ Doesn't show others' posts
- 🎯 Purpose: Manage your own content

## User Experience

### When You Create a Post:

**What You See:**
```
You: [Create Post] "Hello World!"
     ↓
Main Feed: [Empty or shows other users' posts]
           ← Your post is NOT here
     ↓
My Posts Tab: "Hello World!" ← Your post IS here
```

**What Others See:**
```
Other Users:
Main Feed: "Hello World!" ← Your post IS visible to them
```

### Example Scenario:

**User "magice" creates a post:**

**Magice's View:**
- **All Posts Tab**: Sees posts from john, alice, bob (NOT their own)
- **Following Tab**: Sees posts from followed users (NOT their own)
- **My Posts Tab**: Sees their own posts ✅

**Other Users' View (john, alice, bob):**
- **All Posts Tab**: Sees posts from magice, and other users ✅
- **Following Tab**: If following magice, sees magice's posts ✅
- **My Posts Tab**: Sees only their own posts

## Code Flow

```javascript
// 1. Get all posts from blockchain
posts = [
  { author: "0xYourAddress", content: "Your post" },
  { author: "0xOtherUser1", content: "Their post" },
  { author: "0xOtherUser2", content: "Another post" }
]

// 2. Filter based on tab
if (showMyPostsOnly) {
  // My Posts Tab: Show ONLY your posts
  filtered = posts.filter(post => 
    post.author === yourAddress
  );
  // Result: ["Your post"]
  
} else if (showFollowedOnly) {
  // Following Tab: Show followed users (NOT yours)
  filtered = posts.filter(post => 
    post.author !== yourAddress && 
    isFollowing(post.author)
  );
  // Result: [followed users' posts, excluding yours]
  
} else {
  // All Posts Tab: Show ALL others (NOT yours)
  filtered = posts.filter(post => 
    post.author !== yourAddress
  );
  // Result: ["Their post", "Another post"]
}
```

### Test Case 1: Create a Post
1. Create a new post
2. Check "All Posts" tab → Should NOT see your post
3. Check "My Posts" tab → Should see your post ✅

2. "All Posts" tab → Shows 0 of your posts
3. "My Posts" tab → Shows all 3 of your posts
4. Other users see all 3 in their feed

### Test Case 3: Following Tab
1. Follow some users
2. Create a post
3. "Following" tab → Shows followed users' posts, NOT yours
4. Your followers see your post in their "Following" tab

## Summary

**Main Feed (All Posts):**

**My Posts Tab:**
- ✅ Your posts are VISIBLE
- ❌ Other users' posts are HIDDEN

**Following Tab:**

**For Other Users:**

This creates a clean, intuitive experience where you focus on others' content in the main feed, while having a dedicated space to manage your own posts! 🎉
