# "My Posts" Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "X Helios" button has been replaced with a "My Posts" button that displays only the current user's posts. Additionally, the user's own posts are now hidden from the "All Posts" and "Following" tabs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feed.js Updates

#### Added State Management
```javascript
const [showMyPostsOnly, setShowMyPostsOnly] = useState(false);
```

#### Updated URL Synchronization
- Added `/my-posts` route handling
- When user navigates to `/my-posts`, the "My Posts" tab becomes active

#### Modified Post Filtering Logic

**My Posts Tab:**
- Shows only posts where `post.author === current user's address`

**All Posts Tab:**
- Shows posts from all registered users
- **Excludes** posts from the current user
- Filter: `post.author !== current user's address`

**Following Tab:**
- Shows posts from users the current user follows
- **Excludes** posts from the current user
- Filter: `post.author !== current user's address AND post.author in following list`

#### Updated UI
- Replaced the Twitter/X link with a button
- Changed text from "X Helios" to "My Posts"
- Added proper active state styling
- Added navigation to `/my-posts` route

### 2. App.js Updates

#### Added Route Handling
```javascript
else if (path === '/my-posts') {
  setActiveTab('feed');
}
```

## User Experience

### Before
- "X Helios" button linked to Twitter
- User's posts appeared in all tabs
- No dedicated view for user's own posts

### After
- "My Posts" button shows only user's posts
- User's posts are hidden from "All Posts" and "Following"
- Clean separation of content:
  - **All Posts**: Community posts (excluding yours)
  - **Following**: Posts from people you follow (excluding yours)
  - **My Posts**: Only your posts

## Benefits

1. **Better Content Organization**: Clear separation between community content and personal posts
2. **Improved Privacy**: Users can easily manage and view their own posts separately
3. **Enhanced UX**: Users can focus on community content without seeing their own posts mixed in
4. **URL Support**: Direct access via `/my-posts` URL
5. **Bookmarkable**: Users can bookmark their posts page

## Technical Details

### Post Filtering Implementation

```javascript
if (showMyPostsOnly) {
  // Show only current user's posts
  const myPosts = posts.filter(post => 
    post.author.toLowerCase() === address?.toLowerCase()
  );
  setFilteredPosts(myPosts);
} else if (showFollowedOnly) {
  // Exclude own posts from Following tab
  const followedPosts = posts.filter(post => {
    if (post.author.toLowerCase() === address?.toLowerCase()) {
      return false;
    }
    return following.includes(post.author.toLowerCase());
  });
  setFilteredPosts(followedPosts);
} else {
  // Exclude own posts from All Posts tab
  const postsFromRegistered = posts.filter(post => {
    if (post.author.toLowerCase() === address?.toLowerCase()) {
      return false;
    }
    return hasRegisteredProfile(post.author);
  });
  setFilteredPosts(postsFromRegistered);
}
```

### URL Routes

| Tab | URL | Content |
|-----|-----|---------|
| All Posts | `/all-posts` | All community posts except yours |
| Following | `/following` | Posts from followed users except yours |
| My Posts | `/my-posts` | Only your posts |
