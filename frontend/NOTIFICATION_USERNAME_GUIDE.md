# Notification Username Display Guide

## Overview
Notifications now display the actual username chosen by the user when they created their profile (e.g., "magice") for all notification types: follow, tag, comment, like.

## How It Works

### 1. Username Fetching Process

When notifications load:
```javascript
// Step 1: Get notifications from blockchain
const notifications = await getUserNotifications(address);

// Step 2: For each notification, fetch the sender's username
for (const notif of notifications) {
  const profile = await getUserProfile(notif.sender);
  const username = profile[0]; // e.g., "magice"
  
  // Step 3: Store username in notification object
  notification.username = username;
}

// Step 4: Display in UI
<span>@{username}</span> // Shows: @magice
```

### 2. Notification Display Format

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [🟠] 👤 @magice                    │  ← Username here
│         started following you       │
│         Just now                🟠  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## All Notification Types

### Follow Notification:
```
@magice started following you
```

### Like Notification:
```
@magice liked your post
```

### Comment Notification:
```
@magice commented on your post
```

### Tag/Mention Notification:
```
@magice mentioned you in a post
```

### Comment Like Notification:
```
@magice liked your comment
```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Create a Profile
1. User "magice" creates their profile
2. Sets username to "magice"
3. Saves profile to blockchain

### Step 2: Perform Action
User "magice" performs one of these actions:
- Follows you
- Likes your post
- Comments on your post
- Tags you in a post

### Step 3: Check Notification
1. Open notifications panel
2. You should see: **@magice** [action]
3. NOT: "@Anonymous User"

### Step 4: Verify in Console
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
✅ Got username for 0x...: magice
✅ Using pre-loaded username: magice
```

## Debugging

### If You See "Anonymous User":

#### Check 1: User Has Profile?
```javascript
// In browser console:
const profile = await readContract({
  address: contractData.address,
  abi: contractData.abi,
  functionName: 'getUserProfile',
  args: ['USER_ADDRESS_HERE']
});
console.log('Profile:', profile);
// Should show: ["magice", "QmIPFSHash...", true]
```

#### Check 2: Username Not Empty?
```javascript
// Check if username field is filled
console.log('Username:', profile[0]);
// Should show: "magice"
// NOT: "" (empty string)
```

#### Check 3: Console Logs
Look for these logs when opening notifications:
```
📥 Loading notifications for: 0x...
✅ Loaded 1 notifications from blockchain
✅ Got username for 0xABC...: magice  ← Should show username
📋 Notification 0: {
  type: "follow",
  sender: "0xABC...",
  username: "magice",  ← Should NOT be "Anonymous User"
  ...
}
✅ Notifications loaded into state: [...]
✅ Using pre-loaded username: magice  ← Confirms username is used
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User "magice" Follows You
**What happens:**
1. magice clicks Follow button
2. Blockchain creates notification
3. Your app fetches notification
4. Fetches magice's profile
5. Gets username: "magice"
6. Displays: **@magice started following you**

### Scenario 2: User "john" Likes Your Post
**What happens:**
1. john clicks Like button
2. Blockchain creates notification
3. Your app fetches notification
4. Fetches john's profile
5. Gets username: "john"
6. Displays: **@john liked your post**

### Scenario 3: User "alice" Tags You
**What happens:**
1. alice creates post with @yourname
2. Blockchain creates notification
3. Your app fetches notification
4. Fetches alice's profile
5. Gets username: "alice"
6. Displays: **@alice mentioned you in a post**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Shows "Anonymous User"
**Cause:** The person who performed the action hasn't created their profile yet.
**Solution:** They need to:
1. Click profile icon
2. Enter username (e.g., "magice")
3. Save profile

### Issue 2: Shows "Loading..."
**Cause:** Username is still being fetched from blockchain.
**Solution:** Wait a few seconds, it should update automatically.

### Issue 3: Username Not Updating
**Cause:** Notification panel needs to be refreshed.
**Solution:**
1. Close notification panel
2. Reopen it
3. Username should now display

### Issue 4: Different Username Shown
**Cause:** User changed their username after performing the action.
**Solution:** This is expected - it shows their current username, not the username at the time of the action.

## Code Flow

```
User Action (Follow/Like/Comment/Tag)
    ↓
Blockchain Creates Notification
    ↓
NotificationCreated Event Fired
    ↓
Your App Receives Event
    ↓
loadNotifications() Function Called
    ↓
For Each Notification:
    ├─ Get sender address

    ├─ Extract username from profile[0]
    └─ Store in notification.username
    ↓
NotificationItem Component
    ↓
Display: @{notification.username}

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] User "magice" has created their profile
- [ ] Username is set to "magice" (not empty)
- [ ] Profile is saved to blockchain
- [ ] magice performs an action (follow/like/comment/tag)
- [ ] You open notifications panel
- [ ] Console shows: `✅ Got username for ...: magice`
- [ ] Console shows: `✅ Using pre-loaded username: magice`
- [ ] Notification displays: **@magice** [action]
- [ ] NOT showing: "@Anonymous User"

## Expected Console Output

### Success Case:
```
📥 Loading notifications for: 0xYourAddress...
📊 Blockchain notifications data: [...]
✅ Loaded 1 notifications from blockchain
✅ Got username for 0xMagiceAddress...: magice
📋 Notification 0: {
  type: "follow",
  sender: "0xMagiceAddress...",
  username: "magice",
  message: "started following you",
  timestamp: 1234567890000,
  read: false
}
✅ Notifications loaded into state: [...]
🔔 ========== NOTIFICATIONS PANEL ==========
📊 Rendering notifications panel
📋 Notifications count: 1
📋 Notifications data: [{username: "magice", ...}]
✅ Using pre-loaded username: magice
```

### If User Has No Profile:
```
✅ Loaded 1 notifications from blockchain
⚠️ Empty username for 0xAddress...
📋 Notification 0: {
  username: "Anonymous User",  ← No profile created
  ...
}
```

## Summary

✅ **Username is fetched** when notifications load  
✅ **Stored in notification object** as `notification.username`  
✅ **Displayed in UI** as `@{username}`  
✅ **Works for all types**: follow, like, comment, tag, mention  
✅ **Real username shown**: e.g., "@magice" not "@Anonymous User"  

The username will display correctly as long as the person who performed the action has created their profile with a username!
