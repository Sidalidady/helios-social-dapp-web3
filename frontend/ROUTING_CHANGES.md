# URL Routing Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed React Router DOM
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 2. Updated Files

#### **App.js**
- Added React Router imports: `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`
- Added `navigate` and `location` hooks to `AppContent` component
- Added URL synchronization effect that updates `activeTab` based on current URL path
- Updated navigation handlers to use `navigate()` for all buttons:
  - **Feed** → `/feed`
  - **Trending** → `/trending`
  - **Communities** → `/communities`
  - **Profile** → `/profile`
- Wrapped the app with `<Router>` and `<Routes>` in the main export

#### **Feed.js**
- Added React Router imports: `useNavigate`, `useLocation`
- Added URL synchronization for "All Posts" and "Following" tabs
- Updated button handlers:
  - **All Posts** → `/all-posts`
  - **Following** → `/following`

### 3. URL Routes Available

| Button/Tab | URL Path |
|------------|----------|
| Feed | `/feed` or `/` |
| Trending | `/trending` |
| Communities | `/communities` |
| Profile | `/profile` |
| All Posts | `/all-posts` |
| Following | `/following` |
| My Posts | `/my-posts` |

### 4. How It Works

1. When a user clicks any navigation button, the URL changes to the corresponding path
2. The browser's back/forward buttons work correctly
3. Users can bookmark specific pages (e.g., `https://stellari-social-helios-web3.vercel.app/following`)
4. Direct URL access works (e.g., typing `/trending` in the address bar)
5. The active tab state syncs with the URL automatically

### 5. Features

- ✅ URL changes on button clicks
- ✅ Browser back/forward navigation
- ✅ Bookmarkable URLs
- ✅ Direct URL access
- ✅ State synchronization with URL
- ✅ No page reloads (SPA behavior)

### 6. "My Posts" Feature

The "My Posts" button (previously "X Helios") has been redesigned:

**Changes:**
- ✅ Renamed from "X Helios" to "My Posts"
- ✅ No longer links to Twitter/X
- ✅ Shows only the current user's posts when clicked
- ✅ User's own posts are **hidden** from "All Posts" tab
- ✅ User's own posts are **hidden** from "Following" tab
- ✅ User can only see their posts in the "My Posts" tab
- ✅ URL changes to `/my-posts` when clicked

**Behavior:**
- **All Posts**: Shows posts from all registered users **except** the current user
- **Following**: Shows posts from users you follow **except** your own posts
- **My Posts**: Shows **only** your posts

## Testing

To test the routing:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Click on different navigation buttons and observe the URL changing
3. Use browser back/forward buttons
4. Try accessing URLs directly (e.g., `/trending`, `/following`, `/my-posts`)
5. Refresh the page and verify the correct tab is active
6. Create some posts and verify they only appear in "My Posts" tab
