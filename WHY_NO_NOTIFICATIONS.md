## 🔔 How Notifications Work

### **Smart Contract Creates Notification:**

When your friend clicks "Follow":

```solidity
function followUser(address _userToFollow) external {
    // ... follow logic ...
    
    // Create notification for you
    _createNotification(
        _userToFollow,      // You (recipient)
        msg.sender,         // Friend (sender)
        NOTIF_FOLLOW,       // Type: follow
        0                   // No related post
    );
    
    emit UserFollowed(msg.sender, _userToFollow);
}
```

### **Your dApp Reads Notification:**

```javascript
// Read notifications from blockchain
const { data: notifications } = useReadContract({
  functionName: 'getUserNotifications',
  args: [yourAddress],
});
```

## 📊 Notification Types

1. **Follow** - "started following you"
2. **Like** - "liked your post"
