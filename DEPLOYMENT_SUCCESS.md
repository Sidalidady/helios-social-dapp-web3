### Issue: Old users missing
**Solution:**
- This is expected - new contract = fresh start
- Old users need to create profiles again

### Issue: Vercel deployment fails
**Solution:**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all files are committed
- Ensure ABI is valid JSON
- Try redeploying manually
