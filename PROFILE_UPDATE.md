## 📱 How It Works Now

### Setting Up Your Profile:

1. **Connect Your Wallet** (if not already connected)
2. **Click "Profile"** button in the header
3. **See Your Wallet Address** displayed at the top
4. **Your existing profile loads automatically** (if you've set one before)
5. **Edit your details:**
   - Username (shown on all your posts)
   - Bio (personal description)
   - Profile Image (optional)
6. **Click "Save Profile"**
7. **Confirm transaction** in MetaMask
8. **Done!** Your profile is linked to your wallet

### Viewing Profiles on Posts:

- **Posts show usernames** instead of just wallet addresses
- **Your posts** are marked with a "You" badge
- **Other users' posts** show their username or wallet address
- **Hover over addresses** to see the full wallet address

## 🔗 Wallet Integration

### How Profile Links to Wallet:

```
Your Wallet Address (0x123...)
    ↓
Profile Smart Contract
    ↓
Stores: Username + IPFS Hash
    ↓
IPFS Storage
    ↓
Contains: Bio + Profile Image
```

### Data Flow:

1. **Profile Creation:**
   - User fills form → Data uploaded to IPFS → IPFS hash stored on-chain with username
   
2. **Profile Display:**
   - Post loads → Fetches author's profile → Shows username from blockchain → Loads full profile from IPFS

3. **Profile Editing:**
   - Opens modal → Loads existing data from blockchain → Fetches from IPFS → User edits → Saves to blockchain

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Profile Modal:
- ✅ Shows connected wallet address
- ✅ Displays loading state while fetching profile
- ✅ Pre-fills existing data
- ✅ Shows character counters
- ✅ Image preview

### Post Display:
- ✅ Username shown prominently
- ✅ Wallet address shown below (smaller)
- ✅ "You" badge on own posts
- ✅ Consistent styling

## 💾 Data Storage

### On Blockchain:
- Username (string, max 30 chars)
- IPFS hash (pointer to full profile)
- Linked to wallet address

### In IPFS:
```json
{
  "username": "YourUsername",
  "bio": "Your bio text",
  "address": "0x...",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Components Added:
1. **Wallet Info Display** in Profile modal
2. **Profile Loading State** indicator
3. **Username Display** on posts
4. **Author Profile Fetching** in Post component

### Hooks Used:
- `useReadContract()` - Fetch user profiles
- `useWriteContract()` - Update profile
- `useAccount()` - Get connected wallet
- `useEffect()` - Load and sync data

### Smart Contract Functions:
- `getUserProfile(address)` - Returns [username, ipfsHash]
- `updateProfile(username, ipfsHash)` - Updates user profile

## 🎯 User Benefits

1. **Identity:** Your username appears on all your posts
2. **Consistency:** Profile linked to your wallet forever
3. **Portability:** Take your identity across sessions
4. **Recognition:** Other users can identify you by username
5. **Personalization:** Add bio and profile picture

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What's Public:
- ✅ Username
- ✅ Bio
- ✅ Profile image
- ✅ Wallet address

### What's Private:
- ✅ Your private key (never exposed)
- ✅ Transaction signing (via MetaMask)

### Best Practices:
- Don't use sensitive information in bio
- Profile images are public on IPFS
- Username is permanent once set (can be updated but costs gas)
