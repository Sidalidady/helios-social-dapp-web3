## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (2 minutes):

   - Friend clicks "Users" button
   - Friend finds your username
   - Friend clicks "Follow"
   - Friend confirms transaction

2. **Check your notifications**:
   - Wait 10-30 seconds (for transaction)
   - Look at bell icon (top right)
   - Should show: 🔔 (1)
   - Click bell icon
   - See: "@friend started following you"

### Expected Result:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔔 Notifications              │
├────────────────────────────────┤
│  👤 @friend                    │
│     started following you      │

## 🔍 Debugging

### If Notifications Don't Appear:

1. **Check Browser Console (F12)**:
   ```
   Look for:
   ✅ "NotificationCreated event received"
   ✅ "New notification for you! Refetching..."
   ✅ "Loaded X notifications from blockchain"
   ```

2. **Check Contract Address**:
   - Should be: `0x871f6b513172b39B2069592f91f17895818BF393`
   - Check in console: Look for "Contract:" in logs

3. **Check Blockchain**:
   - Go to: https://explorer.helioschainlabs.org
   - Search your wallet address
   - Look for "NotificationCreated" events

### Common Issues:

#### Issue 1: Wrong Contract Address
**Symptom**: No notifications at all  
**Fix**: Update Vercel environment variable to new contract

#### Issue 2: Transaction Not Confirmed
**Symptom**: Notification appears after long delay  
**Solution**: Wait 10-30 seconds for blockchain confirmation

#### Issue 3: Browser Cache
**Symptom**: Old data showing  
**Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
