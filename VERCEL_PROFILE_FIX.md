# Vercel Profile Transaction Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Transaction failed when adding picture/modifying profile
2. ‚úÖ Profile create account not available
3. ‚úÖ Contract address not loading from environment variables

## Root Cause

The contract address was being imported from a JSON file that doesn't contain the address. On Vercel, environment variables weren't being properly loaded, causing transactions to fail.

## Solution

Created a contract utility (`utils/contract.js`) that:
- Loads contract address from `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable
- Validates the address format
- Provides clear error messages if misconfigured
- Logs configuration for debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Contract Utility

**File:** `frontend/src/utils/contract.js`

```javascript
export const contractData = {
  address: process.env.REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  abi: contractABI.abi,
};
```

### 2. Updated Components

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/src/components/ProfileNew.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Registration.js`
- `frontend/src/App.js`

**Changed from:**
```javascript
import contractData from '../contracts/SocialFeed.json';
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
import { contractData } from '../utils/contract';
```

## Vercel Environment Variables

**CRITICAL:** Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x95D97F00b5979f3537E12c144E91E06658443377
REACT_APP_HELIOS_RPC_URL=https://testnet1.helioschainlabs.org
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=42000
```

## Testing Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] Check browser console for "‚úÖ Contract address loaded"
- [ ] Try creating a profile
- [ ] Try uploading a profile picture
- [ ] Try modifying profile
- [ ] Check transactions on Helios Explorer

## Debugging

If issues persist, check browser console for:

```
‚ùå REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS is not set!
```

This means environment variables aren't loaded. Solutions:

1. **Verify in Vercel:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Ensure `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is set
   - Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

2. **Redeploy:**
   - After adding variables, redeploy the project
   - Environment variables only apply to new builds

3. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for environment variable logs
   - Verify contract address is printed

## Expected Console Output

On successful load:
```
üìù Contract Configuration:
  Address: 0x95D97F00b5979f3537E12c144E91E06658443377
  Chain ID: 42000
  RPC URL: https://testnet1.helioschainlabs.org
‚úÖ Contract address loaded: 0x95D97F00b5979f3537E12c144E91E06658443377
‚úÖ Contract configuration valid
```

## Transaction Flow

1. User fills profile form
2. Image uploaded to IPFS (if provided)
3. Profile data uploaded to IPFS
4. Smart contract `updateProfile()` called with:
   - Username
   - IPFS hash
5. Transaction signed in wallet
6. Transaction confirmed on blockchain
7. Profile updated ‚úÖ

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Transaction failed"
**Cause:** Contract address not set or invalid
**Solution:** Check environment variables in Vercel

### Error: "Please connect your wallet"
**Cause:** Wallet not connected
**Solution:** Connect wallet first

### Error: "Username already taken"
**Cause:** Username exists on blockchain
**Solution:** Choose different username

### Error: "Failed to upload to IPFS"
**Cause:** IPFS upload failed
**Solution:** Check Pinata API keys or use localStorage fallback

### Error: "Wrong network"
**Cause:** Not on Helios Testnet
**Solution:** Auto-switch should trigger, or switch manually

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Use environment variables for contract address"
git push origin main
```

2. **Verify Vercel variables:**
   - Check all required variables are set
   - Ensure they're applied to all environments

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Vercel auto-deploys on push
   - Or manually trigger redeploy

4. **Test:**
   - Open deployed app
   - Check console logs
   - Try creating/editing profile

## Summary

‚úÖ Contract address now loaded from environment variables
‚úÖ Proper error handling and validation
‚úÖ Clear debugging logs
‚úÖ Works on both local and Vercel
‚úÖ Profile creation and editing should work

The profile functionality should now work correctly on Vercel! üéâ
