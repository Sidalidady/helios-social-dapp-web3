# üîß After Updating Vercel Environment Variables

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: 3 Steps Required!

Updating environment variables is NOT enough. You must:

1. ‚úÖ Update environment variables (You did this!)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **REDEPLOY on Vercel** (Required!)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear browser cache** (Required!)

---

## Step 1: Redeploy on Vercel ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL!

### Why?
Environment variables only take effect AFTER redeployment!

### How to Redeploy:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Click on your project:**
   `helios-social-dapp-web3`

3. **Click "Deployments" tab** (top menu)

4. **Find the latest deployment** (top of the list)

5. **Click the three dots (...)** on the right

6. **Click "Redeploy"**

7. **Click "Redeploy" again** to confirm

8. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

9. **Look for "‚úì Ready"** status

---

## Step 2: Clear Browser Cache ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL!

### Why?
Your browser cached the old contract address!

### How to Clear Cache:

#### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

#### Option 2: Clear Cache Completely
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows/Linux)
2. Or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Select "All time"
5. Click "Clear data"

#### Option 3: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open new incognito/private window
2. Go to your dApp URL
3. Test there (no cache)

---

## Step 3: Test Your dApp

### After Redeploy + Clear Cache:

1. **Open your dApp URL**

2. **Disconnect wallet** (if connected)

3. **Connect wallet again**

4. **Check what happens:**

   **If you already created profile:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see "Welcome back @username"
   - ‚úÖ Should NOT see "Create Account Profile"
   - ‚úÖ Can access dApp immediately

   **If you never created profile:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see "Create Account Profile"
   - ‚úÖ Create profile
   - ‚úÖ Should see "Welcome to Helios Social!"
   - ‚úÖ Can access dApp

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still shows "Create Account Profile" after I already created one

**Possible Causes:**

#### 1. Vercel Not Redeployed
**Solution:**
- Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
- Check if latest deployment is "Ready"
- If not, redeploy again
- Wait for "‚úì Ready" status

#### 2. Browser Cache Not Cleared
**Solution:**
- Clear cache completely (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
- Or use incognito window
- Or try different browser

#### 3. Wrong Contract Address
**Solution:**
- Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Verify `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is:
  ```
  0x871f6b513172b39B2069592f91f17895818BF393
  ```
- If wrong, fix it and redeploy

#### 4. Profile Created on Different Contract
**Solution:**
- You may have created profile on OLD contract
- Need to create NEW profile on NEW contract
- This is normal after contract upgrade

#### 5. Wallet Address Different
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using the SAME wallet address
- That created the profile
- Check wallet address in MetaMask
