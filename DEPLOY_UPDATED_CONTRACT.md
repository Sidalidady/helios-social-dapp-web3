# 🚀 Deploy Updated Smart Contract with Notification Events

## ✅ What Was Added

The smart contract now emits `NotificationCreated` events for:
- ✅ **Post Likes** - When someone likes your post
- ✅ **Follows** - When someone follows you
- ✅ **Comments** - When someone comments on your post
- ✅ **Comment Likes** - When someone likes your comment

## 📝 Changes Made

### Smart Contract (`SocialFeed.sol`):
1. Added `NotificationCreated` event
2. Emit notification in `likePost()` function
3. Emit notification in `followUser()` function
4. Emit notification in `addComment()` function
5. Emit notification in `likeComment()` function (updated signature)

### Frontend (`Notifications.js`):
1. Listen to `NotificationCreated` event
2. Automatically save notifications to localStorage
3. Real-time notification updates

### Frontend (`Comments.js`):
1. Updated `likeComment` to pass `postId` parameter

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Compile the Updated Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Expected output:
```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Helios Testnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network helios-testnet
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Deploying SocialFeed contract to Helios Testnet...
📝 Deploying with account: 0x032f9d761989245960a17C38De5Cc5Fac14D0b64
💰 Account balance: XXXX HLS
📦 Deploying SocialFeed contract...
✅ SocialFeed deployed to: 0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
🔍 View on explorer: https://explorer.helioschainlabs.org/address/0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Step 3: Copy the New Contract Address

From the output above, copy the new contract address (e.g., `0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`)

### Step 4: Update Frontend Configuration

#### A. Update `frontend/public/env-config.js`:
```javascript
window.ENV_CONFIG = {
  REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: '0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS', // ← Update this
  REACT_APP_HELIOS_RPC_URL: 'https://testnet1.helioschainlabs.org',
  REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID: '42000',
  REACT_APP_IPFS_GATEWAY: 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/',
  REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY: process.env.REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY || '',
  REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_KEY: process.env.REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_KEY || '',
};
```

#### B. Update `frontend/.env.example`:
```env
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Step 5: Copy New ABI

```bash
Copy-Item "artifacts/contracts/SocialFeed.sol/SocialFeed.json" "frontend/src/contracts/SocialFeed.json" -Force
```

### Step 6: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to: **Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

Update:
```
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xNEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

For all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Step 7: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Deploy updated contract with notification events"
git push origin main
```

### Step 8: Verify Deployment

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy
2. Open your app
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Connect wallet
5. Have a friend like your post
6. Look for in console:
   ```
   🔔 NotificationCreated event received: 1 events
   ✅ Processing notification: { type: 'like', from: '0x...' }
   💾 Notification saved to localStorage
   ```
7. Click bell icon 🔔
8. **See the notification!** ✅

## 🎯 New Event Structure

```solidity
event NotificationCreated(
    address indexed recipient,    // Who receives the notification
    address indexed sender,        // Who triggered the action
    string notificationType,       // "like", "follow", "comment", "comment_like"
    uint256 relatedId,            // Post ID or Comment ID
    uint256 timestamp             // When it happened
);
```

## 📊 Notification Types

| Type | Triggered When | Message |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `like` | Someone likes your post | "liked your post" |
| `follow` | Someone follows you | "started following you" |
| `comment` | Someone comments on your post | "commented on your post" |
| `comment_like` | Someone likes your comment | "liked your comment" |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No notifications appearing

**Solution 1: Check Console**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for these messages:
🔔 NotificationCreated event received: 1 events
✅ Processing notification: { type: 'like', from: '0x...' }
💾 Notification saved to localStorage
```

**Solution 2: Check localStorage**
```javascript
// In console, run:
localStorage.getItem('notifications_0xYourAddress')
```

**Solution 3: Clear and retry**
```javascript
// Clear notifications
localStorage.clear();
// Try again
```

### Issue: Contract deployment fails

**Solution:**
- Check you have HLS tokens: https://faucet.helioschainlabs.org
- Check PRIVATE_KEY is set in `.env`
- Check network connection

### Issue: Frontend not updated

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Check contract address is updated
- Check ABI is copied

## 📈 Benefits of Smart Contract Events

### Before (Old System):
- ❌ Events only in frontend
- ❌ Lost if localStorage cleared
- ❌ No cross-device sync
- ❌ No permanent record

### After (New System):
- ✅ Events from blockchain
- ✅ Permanent record
- ✅ Can be indexed by The Graph
- ✅ Works across devices
- ✅ Can rebuild notification history
- ✅ True Web3 solution

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### Phase 1: ✅ DONE
- Smart contract events
- Frontend listening
- localStorage caching

### Phase 2: Future Enhancements
1. **IndexedDB Migration**
   - Better storage than localStorage
   - Already implemented in `notificationDB.js`
   - Just need to integrate

2. **The Graph Integration**
   - Index all notifications
   - Fast queries
   - Historical data

3. **Push Protocol**
   - Real push notifications
   - Works when app closed
   - Best UX
